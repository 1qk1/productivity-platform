# ⏲ Productivity platform (no name, please suggest one at [this issue](https://github.com/1qk1/productivity-platform/issues/42))

This project is aimed towards those who want to be more productive, be more focused or want help managing their time.

## ▶ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### ⚙️ Installing

A step by step series that will get your development environment running.

1. Navigate into the project folder (this folder).

2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull the submodules (the backend is in a separate repo but linked to this one).

3. Install dependencies with `npm run installdeps`.

4. In the backend folder, make a `.env` file with the keys specified in the README.md file and take a look at the .env.example file. For the frontend, the .env files are needed only in production.

5. Go to the project's folder again.

6. Run `npm run dev` to start the backend and the webclient.

7. You're ready to code.

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/1qk1/productivity-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.

## 🔢 Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. When you submit a pull request, increment the appropriate part of the version in the `package.json` file.

For example in version 1.3.4, the first number is the major release, second the minor release (minor features and stuff), and the third is for small stuff and bugfixes.

For every part of the version you increase, the parts after that, will be 0, for example 1.3.4 => 1.4.0, not 1.4.4

### ⚙️ Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

1. Navigate into the project folder.

2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

3. In the backend folder, make a `.env` file with 2 keys: `MONGODB_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`, and then give them a database url and a jwt secret.

4. Go to the project's root folder again.

5. Run `npm run dev` to start the backend and the webclient.

6. You're ready to code.

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/1qk1/productivity-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.

## 🔢 Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. When you submit a pull request, increment the appropriate part of the version in the `package.json` file.

For example in version 1.3.4, the first number is the major release, second the minor release (minor features and stuff), and the third is for small stuff and bugfixes.

For every part of the version you increase, the parts after that, will be 0, for example 1.3.4 => 1.4.0, not 1.4.4
